sessionID:
	The default built configuration sessionID is set to a random guid - this needs to be empty and the user must configure or create a new one (maybe by default)

sWho:
	Usernames need to be unique - when in settings setting the user name, do a DB check to make sure this username has not been changed - also this cannot be changed (except through the config file hmm)
